# Lockout-Bot
# This document will help you setup your project:

 There are  requirements(packages/libraries) that you will need to install:
 write the following command in the terminal : "pip install -r Requirements.txt"
 for the people concerned about what you are installing , you can just go to the 'Requirements.txt' file and view everything

# You also need to make environment variables (they are basically variable that your code can access globally), to make them follow the following steps:
 1. go to the most parent(root/biggest) folder :
 2. select 'make a new file'
 3. name the file ".env" (dont put double citation marks):

# then for discord setup:  

 1. go to your desired browser , paste in the search bar : "https://discord.com/developers/applications"
 2. click 'new application'
 3. go to Oauth2 , in scopes -> select bot ; in Bot Permission -> administrator
 4. go to the bottom of the page(0Auth2) : copy the generated url , send it to chirag to get your bot  added
 5. if you want the token(you want it , trust me): go to 'Bot'; click on Reset Token ; copy the Token and add it to the '.env file that you created earlier'
