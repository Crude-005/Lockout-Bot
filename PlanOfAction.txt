Game Design:
	Duel 1:
		Lockout system 
		First to solve question take the points and the question becomes locked for the other player
		Check both players have not solved those questions first
		Questions will be on the left and right of the lowest rated player

	Duel 2:

		Each question will lose points overtime so player who solves first gets more points

	Tournament 1:
		Exact format of duel 1 but for multiple players
		
	Tournament 2:
		Teams of 4 players
		Players will duel against each other based on their rating ranking in the team
		Each position will have a rating range requirement
